# kubemci

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-multicluster-ingress/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-multicluster-ingress)

kubemci is a tool to configure Kubernetes ingress to load balance traffic across
multiple Kubernetes clusters.

This is a work in progress, not production ready yet.

This is not an official Google product.

## Getting started

You can try out kubemci using the [zone printer example](/examples/zone-printer).

Follow the instructions as detailed [here](/examples/zone-printer/README.md).

## More information

We have a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Yt_1yICfk) explaining what
kubemci is intended for. It also shows a demo of setting up a multicluster
ingress.

We also have an [FAQ](/FAQs.md) for common questions.
